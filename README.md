### host discovery

- new scan --> host discovery

### vulnerability scanning

- new scan --> basic network scan

- write target iPv4 adress for scanning

        !!! Be carefull about URL.. Use only for the local scans.. Url must be in this format : 127.0.0.1!!!

- for local scanning, write target in iPv4 or iPv6 format..

        127.0.0.1 --> local scan

- This scan shows all infos about localhost and working ports. but have not detailed info about app working on spesific port.

- a big CHALLENGE

        how can i scan my app working on 127.0.0.1:PORT???
